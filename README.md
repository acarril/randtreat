# Stata program: `randtreat`
Random treatment assignment with unequal treatment fractions and dealing with misfits.

## Description
**`randtreat`** is a Stata program that performs random treatment assignment. It can handle an arbitrary number of treatments and unequal treatment fractions, which are common in real-world randomized control trials. Stratified randomization can be achieved by optionally specifying a variable list that defines multiple strata. It also provides several methods to deal with *misfits*, a practical issue that arises in treatment assignment whenever observations can't be neatly distributed among treatments. The command performs all tasks in a way that marks misfit observations and provides several methods to deal with those misfits.

When run, it creates a new variable named `treatment` that encodes the treatment allocation. The default number of treatments is two (a control group and a treatment group), but more can be specified with the `mu:lt(integer)` option. Also, unequal fractions of treatments may be specified using the  `u:nequal(fractions)` option. Random assignment with all these options can be done within each strata defined by the unique combinations of values of `varlist`. The data will be sorted by `varlist` and `treatment`, unless the `so:rtpreserve` option is issued. The seed can be set with the `se:tseed(#)` option, so the random assignment can be replicated.

When the number of observations in a given stratum is not a multiple of the number of even treatments, each stratum will have *misfits* (i.e. units that can't be neatly distributed among the treatments). If unequal treatments are specified, then the problem arises whenever the number of observations in a given stratum is not a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the fractions' denominators. When the command is run, it will display the number of misfits that the current setup yields. By specifying `mi:sfits(method)`, one can choose how to deal with those misfits.
